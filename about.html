<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    I'm Bradley Turner and I'm a 26 year old packaging designer at abbe with a Honours Degree in Industrial Design. I
    also run a small business, Algebuckina Design, in my spare time.
</p>

<p>
    I'm looking at getting into a creative and challenging design role and expanding my knowledge within the industry. I
    am proficient in SolidWorks and marking up drawing sheets. I'm also a very keen model builder, always wanting to
    design and build something new for myself or others.
</p>

<p>
    I love a challenge and thrive when I'm thrown into the deep end. Although I have a degree in industrial design, I've
    worked on coding, virtual reality, web design, content creation, streaming and event projects after I graduated to
    push myself and learn new things.
