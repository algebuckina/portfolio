<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    Hello, I'm Bradley Turner and I'm a 26 year old packaging designer at abbe with a Honours Degree in Industrial
    Design.
    I also run a small business, Algebuckina Design, in my spare time.
</p>

<p>
    I'm looking at getting into a creative design roll that's a little more challenging and diverse than cardboard
    boxes. I am proficient in SolidWorks and marking up drawing sheets. I'm also a very keen model builder, always
    wanting to design and build something new for myself or others.
</p>

<p>
    I love a challenge and thrive when I'm thrown into the deep end. Although I have a degree in industrial design, I've
    worked on coding, virtual reality, web design, content creation, streaming and event projects after I graduating to
    push myself and learn new things.
