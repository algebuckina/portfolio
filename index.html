                <h2>Wood Keyboard</h2>
                <h4>Currently in development</h4>
                <p>
                    My fascination with keyboards started when the backlit keyboard I’d been using for 3 years started
                    to
                    fall apart, I wanted something that would last. One thing came to another, and I ended up diving
                    down the rabbit hole that is mechanical keyboards and found longevity and sustainability and mostly
                    ignored in the entire computer peripherals space. I ended up getting a Unicomp terminal keyboard as
                    the original keyboards from IBM still work to this day, but I had an urge to develop and sell a more
                    sustainable mechanical keyboard.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I started the company, Algebuckina Design, and started working on prototypes with my newly acquired
                    CNC router, and have been through many iterations, finding multiple tools and cut files online to
                    try and get to a functional keyboard (as well as struggling through the teething problems of a hobby
                    CNC router) but I’m now very close to having a few working prototypes for usability testing.
                </p>

                <h2>Widevision VR</h2>
                <h4>2021</h4>
                <p>
                    Widevision is an event held each year to showcase Western Sydney Universities Industrial Design
                    cohort. In 2020 the exhibition was moved to a zoom meeting rather than an in-person event due to
                    Covid. In 2021, the university proposed doing a VR exhibition that one of the students would work on
                    for the honours work. I chose to take up this challenge.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I had to teach myself everything from scratch because I had no knowledge of virtual reality at all.
                    I started by developing 2 concepts. A VR space people could attend from anywhere, or a guided tour
                    augmented reality headset. With lockdown restricting movement, I went with the 1st option (though I
                    did have a working AR headset that I could play open TTD on) and begun learning SteamVRs hammer
                    tools, using SolidWorks to create my assets and importing them into SteamVR and eventually having an
                    environment that both myself and my supervisor were really proud of.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As of posting, 2520 different people have entered and experienced this VR environment, and 33 choose

                <h2>Bus Shelter</h2>
                <h4>2020</h4>
                <p>The Bus shelter was my most successful project at university excluding my major work. The 3rd year
                    class on design innovation wanted us to make bus shelters more aesthetically appealing and help us
                    develop our materials selection and sheet metal design skills.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>2 days before our assignment was due, our tutors agreed to have a quick meeting with each team and
                    when we presented our design, they pretty much told us it was unmanufacturable. So straight after
                    that meeting, I took our original concept and redesigned the entire thing in 18 hours. I stuck with
                    the same shape and style, but completely remade every part in SolidWorks, including designing
                    fasteners, hinges and adding bolts. The entire roof of the bus shelter is actually 1 piece of metal,
                    formed into the roof shape with SolidWorks' sheet metal tool. Surviving on caffeine, I finished the
                    design at 6am the next morning and handed it off to the rest of my team to do all our engineering
                    drawings.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We ended up topping the class, having the best model (which I constructed piece by piece) and the
                    most manufacturable design. We were even invited to Widevision 2021 where I was able to showcase the
                    model we made.

                <h2>Baulkham Hills Uniting Church Website</h2>
                <h4>Currently in development</h4>
                <p>I’d recently delved into writing HTML code for a portfolio assignment for university (they wanted us
                    to use WordPress. I used it for about an hour and hated it so started learning HTML) and the Church
                    I attended at the time was looking to revamp their digital presence and was asking for a focus group
                    to be formed around that. I put my hand up and first worked on overhauling their livestreamed
                    services which was timely as covid forced us all into lockdown, but with that project wrapped up in
                    a few weeks, the group wanted to remake their website from the ground up and I took it upon myself
                    to contribute a proposal to the group.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>My website concept was based on NodeBB, a free and open-source forum software that could have custom
                    pages made for it. The forum aspect would make it easier for staff and community members to post
                    information to the site, and the custom pages would let us keep a front-end website like our past
                    one. My proposal was up against another which was just a different hosting software with an
                    identical looking website to the old one. Everyone at the meeting wished me to work more on my
                    design and transfer all the information on the old website over and redesign it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The custom pages plugin took HTML and CSS code and displays it on a blank page with the built-in
                    navigation bar from NodeBB, so I used some of the code from my <a
                        href="https://github.com/algebuckina/old-algebuckina-design-website" target="_blank">attempt at
                        writing my own website from scratch</a> as well as writing new interactions that I learnt from
                    YouTube videos and w3schools tutorials and ended up with something that now stands as the Church’s
                    Website.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have since left the Church, but I still support their website and apply any changes they request
                    at
                    no cost.

                    <p>Something explaining what SWGEmu and mod the galaxy are</p>
                -->
                <p>I’ve been a community manager and content creator at <a href="https://modthegalaxy.com/index.php"
                        target="_blank">Mod the Galaxy</a> for many years now, and
                    throughout my time there, I’ve always needed to tell people how to install mods, and a mod
                    manager would fix this. So naturally I chose to write one myself. I hadn’t written software
                    since year 9 in high school, so it took some time to get back into it, but I was able to get a
                    WinForms project started and the UI done in a few afternoons, taking the colours from the
                    in-game UI, and making my own custom buttons based on it too. I started working on button
                    functionality and got stuck on trying to load and change information in the game files so the
                    project sat on the back burner for about a year. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Throughout this year, a SWGEmu staff member started hinting that I should finish work on it
                    to get it
                    to a functional state. This went on for a while till he said the SWGEmu project was nearing
                    its end,
                    and a content creator would be needed on the team once they move to a full play server and
                    someone
                    who made a mod manager would be looked upon favourably for this position ‘wink wink’. So I
                    dove back
                    into the project and, with some research, got the manager functional and released it to the
                    public.
                    And a few months later, I was accepted onto the SWGEmu team as an event and quest
                    coordinator.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Although I want to rewrite the mod manager in .NET Maui, the WinForms version is still up for
                    download with all its source code <a href="https://github.com/algebuckina/mtg-mod-manager"

                <h2>Custom Car Head Unit</h2>
                <h4>Currently in development</h4>
                <p>
                    I got my Mazda MX5 a few years ago, and it came with some terrible Sony head unit. It plays CDs and
                    connects to my old iPod but refuses to interface with my phone and the Bluetooth sound quality is
                    terrible. Looking on the market, functionality wise, bringing an older car like mine up to modern
                    standards cost upwards of $500, and they don’t even have a volume knob. When I saw this, I chose to
                    take things into my own hands. The head unit I designed uses off the shelf components (when they are
                    in stock, sorry) to make a cheaper competitor than the competition, while keeping the option for
                    android auto compatibility.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>After working on the keyboard for so long, I wanted something I could release quickly as an
                    open-source product to get my companies name out there, and I thought a head unit for my car would
                    be a simple thing to work on. Wow was I wrong. My 1st few prototypes worked but liked falling out of
                    my dash when I accelerated hard, and I never implemented a volume knob. Progress on the unit was
                    going well until my MX5 started having issues and it turned more into a project car than a testing
                    new things on it car. So, the project has stayed dormant until recently, one of my friend’s head
                    unit from Sony just died and instead of looking for a new one, he was wondering if he could use my
                    design, so I’ve been looking to start work on it again. I’m looking at 3D printing the enclosure
                    this time around instead of cutting it on my CNC router and adding a volume knob lol.

                <p>
                    House Worx is an Australian family business dedicated to bringing the enchantment of the Christmas
                    season to your home. Nestled in the Central Coast of New South Wales, they have been a part of the
                    retail industry since 2003, specializing in supplying Kitchenware, Giftware, and Homewares through
                    their physical stores. However, their deep love for all things Christmas sparked a desire to share
                    the joy of festive decorations with our valued customers. In 2017, they took a leap of faith and
                    introduced Christmas Snow Globes to their store, and the response was nothing short of
                    extraordinary.

                    I was recently requested to start working markets on the weekend for House Worx, selling Christmas
                    snow globes. The job involves driving to the event, setting up the Gazebo and products, selling the
                    snow globes throughout the day and then packing up. I used to run a small popup store single handily
                    selling various products depending on season. As well as setting and packing up multiple stores
                    across Sydney as the season starts and ends.

                <p>
                    I've been using CAD in some form or another since I was 14 years old. We used it a lot at
                    Highschool,
                    and I was able to use those skills to teach a bunch of my friends at university how to use it,
                    though in group projects I was always the one making the models and drawing sheets. I can jump from
                    Solidworks, to FreeCAD, to Blender, to ArtiosCAD to ProDesktop 5.0 with ease and feel right at home
                    in all of them. I tend to pick up new software very quickly and I just love making my ideas in 3D.

                    I like pushing myself, and design and innovation has been an amazing way to do that in life. After
                    enjoying Design and Technology at school and being uninterested in Engineering at University, an
                    Industrial Design Degree was the obvious choice. I really shine when it comes to areas I have no
                    expereince with. I love diving into projects where I have to learn and push my understanding and
                    design something truely unique and innovative. My projects highlight my keeness to learn and explore
                    new concepts, mediums and ideas and push them and myself to their limits.

                <p>
                    To put it simply, I like building things with my own hands, and I've been letting that show in my
                    prototyping skills. At abbe and Algebuckina Design, after coming up with a concept, I prototype it
                    to see if my vision actually works. This may be in the form of cutting cardboard with a knife for
                    very rough concepts, to using my CNC router to shape some scrap wood into a pre production
                    prototype. I'm more likely to turn up to a meeting with a few working concepts than a few sketches

                    breif period in 2020. That sent me down a rabbit hole I still haven't recovered from to this
                    day. I've recently published my 1st piece of software, wrote this website from scratch, and I'm now
                    starting to look into C++, .NET MAUI and the Godot game engine as my interest grows in the subject.

                <p>
                    My journey in customer service has been quite the ride. At Bounce Gymnastics, I learned patience and
                    communication while working with children. Later, I jumped into the retail world with House Worx,
                    where I got to fine-tune my
                    customer service skills. Whether it's answering questions, helping customers find what they need, or
                    ensuring a great shopping experience, I'm all in. I'm the kind of person who genuinely enjoys making
                    people smile and feel satisfied. As my journey evolved, I even had the chance to work at markets for
                    House Worx where my ability in setting up a stall and shopfront design has imporved dramatically.
                    I've learned that adaptability and a friendly attitude go a long
                    way in making every customer interaction special.

                    Even though certain companies have tarnished virtual and augmented reality, I don't doubt it will be
                    a key development area in the future. In 2021, I led the creation of Western Sydney University's
                    Widevision VR experience, where I flexed my skills in Steam VR and Hammer to craft an immersive
                    virtual reality adventure. Beyond that, I also delved into creating a prototype for heads-up display
                    glasses, though the concept didn't go too far, I now have a better understanding of how to develop
                    such a product.. I'm driven by a passion for innovation and love exploring the endless possibilities
                    of VR and AR. And the games are fun too.

                    to Assetto Corsa with hour-long sprints. Setting up servers and calculating pitstop times for
                    fairness, our friendly year-long championship offers intense wheel-to-wheel racing and camaraderie.
                    What started as a group of friends having fun has inspired me to expand our championship and explore
                    charitable contributions through per-race donations, giving back to the community while pursuing our

                    CNC routing became my solution to create CAD designs on a larger scale than 3D printing. Assembling
                    a CNC Router from a BlueCarve kit, I've crafted wood mechanical keyboards and sustainable wooden
                    sunglasses. The thrill lies in replacing metal and plastic with wood. CNC routing has sped up and
                    improved my high-fidelity prototyping, enhancing the design process. My vision includes upgrading to
                    an industrial CNC router for keyboard mass production and venturing into custom PCBs—a journey of
                    innovation and entrepreneurship in CNC routing.

                <p>
                    My deep passion for cars, sparked by Top Gear, Gran Turismo, and my dad's influence. From importing
                    a Kei car Pajero Mini from Japan to
                    overhauling my Mazda MX5's engine, I've discovered that cars are a captivating blend of engineering
                    and design. Beyond owning and
                    driving cars, I enjoy virtual racing, relishing moments like watching Le Mans prototype car racing,
                    and guiding others in car selections. Looking ahead, my projects include giving my MX5 a fresh coat
                    of paint, exploring small-range electric cars for daily commuting, venturing into kit car projects,
                    and modernizing classic and older cars. With each step, I bridge the gap between nostalgia and
                    cutting-edge

                <p>
                    My passion for computers and technology ignited when my parents introduced me to a used eMac,
                    opening the door to an ever-evolving world of innovation. Over the years, I've dived deep into this
                    realm, building computers, configuring gaming servers, and mastering a range of operating systems,
                    including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Virtualization is second nature to me, allowing me to create
                    dynamic environments for experimentation. What truly captivates me is not just the ordinary, but the
                    extraordinary within technology. I find myself drawn to constantly
                    seeking innovations that challenge the conventional black rectangle of smartphones. My creative
                    pursuits in technology know no bounds—I'm crafting my own wood mechanical keyboard, developing
                    websites with HTML, integrating them into NodeBB, and even releasing my own software tools. Not to
                    mention, I designed an open-source car head unit powered by a Raspberry Pi. My dream is to become a
                    technology designer, bridging the gap between physical design and the intricacies of software and
                    hardware. With a passion as versatile as technology itself, I'm ready to shape the future of
                    innovation.
