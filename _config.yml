  Hey, I'm a 26 year old Packaging Designer at abbe. I also run a small business, Algebuckina Design, in my spare time. I am proficient in SolidWorks, marking up drawing sheets and I'm getting pretty good at FreeCAD. I'm also a very keen model builder, always wanting to design and build something new for myself or others.
