# My Design Portfolio V2.0

Hey, this is my portfolio V2. V1 I wrote entirely on my own with HTML and CSS and it can be found [here](https://github.com/algebuckina/portfolio/tree/Archived-1.0)

I wanted V2 to be a lot less high mantenance than a site I wrote entirely on my own, and that lead me to jekyll and github pages. I needed to break a linux VM out just to generate the page, but from there is has been smooth sailing since then. And it's still free.

I actually like this way of doing things so much, I'll be transfering Algebuckina Design's website to this format soon. so keep an eye out for that.
